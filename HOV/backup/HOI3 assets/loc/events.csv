The dossier even alleged that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons programme.

disengage_from_gaza_desc;The Israeli disengagement from Gaza also known as "Gaza expulsion" and "Hitnatkut", was the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza, and the dismantling of all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip in 2005. \n \nThe disengagement was proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, adopted by the government on June 6, 2004 and enacted in August 2005. Those Israeli citizens who refused to accept government compensation packages and voluntarily vacate their homes prior to the August 15, 2005 deadline, were evicted by Israeli security forces over a period of several days. \n \nThe unilateral disengagement plan has been criticized from various viewpoints. In Israel, it has been criticized by the settlers themselves, supported by the Israeli right, who saw Ariel Sharon's action as a betrayal of his previous policies of support of settlement. \n \nConversely, the disengagement has been criticized by parts of the Israeli left, who viewed it as nothing more than a mode of stalling negotiations and increasing Israeli presence in the West Bank. The disengagement also did not address wider issues of occupation. Israel retained control over Gaza’s borders, airspace, coastline, infrastructure, power, import-exports, etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

rus_establish_border_lat_desc;Ever since the dissolution of the Soviet Union Latvia had laid claims to the Russian Pskov Oblast. \n \nNow that relations between the our two countries have warmed up we can finish this dispute and have a proper border agreement with Latvia, this will no doubt promote trust and increase relations between our two nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lift_cis_sanctions_desc;The Commonwealth of Independent States sanctions imposed against Abkhazia have become outdated and are hindering the implementation of economic and social programs in the region, as well as causing unjustified hardship for the people of Abkhazia. \n \nPerhaps it is time to lift these sanctions and allow the people of Abkhazia much needed relief, the downside to this is that lifting these sanctions may seem as a recognition by Russia of the breakaway republic from Georgia and perhaps a step for a future plan to annex the region into Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
south_ossetia_intervention_title;South Ossetia Intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
south_ossetia_intervention_desc;Following the recent tensions in the South Ossetia region Georgia has attacked South Ossetia and Georgian troops have reached Tskhinvali the South Oseetian Capital. \n \nThe government in South Ossetia is loyal to Russia and so is the population in the region, this aggressive move by Georgia is surprising but our intelligence has expected that recent events in the region may lead to armed conflict, we must decide how to respond to this event quickly. \n \nWe could ignore the attack on South Ossetia but seeing as Georgia still lays claims to the region they will probably use our inaction to annex the region, this could also cause an uproar at home. \n \nOn the other hand we could go in defence of South Ossetia and drive the invading army back to Georgia, our army should be more that sufficient for this task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
recognize_ost_abk_title;Recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
recognize_ost_abk_desc;The time has come to recognize that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are not part of Georgia. \n \nThe regime in Tbilisi has failed to govern and control these parts and the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have spoken. \n \nWith the act of recognition we can strengthen their elements that are sympathetic to the world view in the Kremlin for the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

However, this Interim Administration, which was not broadly representative, was scheduled to last for only six months, before being replaced by a Transitional Administration. \n \nThe move to this second stage would require the convening of a traditional Afghan "grand assembly", called a Loya Jirga. This Emergency Loya Jirga elected a new Head of State and appointed the Transitional Administration, which, in turn, would run the country for a maximum of two more years until a "fully representative government" could be elected through free and fair elections..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

UNNOTRECCORE;News from the UN Security Council! \n \nOur ambassador to the United Nations has reported that following a meeting of the Security Council a resolution was adopted §Yrejecting§W our claims to transfer a province we have a claim on to our control. \n \nThis is a dissapointing decision by the United Nations, we must now look for other ways to retake our territory besides diplomatic maneuvers which have proved ineffective. \n \nThe rejection by the Security Council has also had an impact on our domestic situation with right wing nationalist parties and popular figures calling to take our claims by force and disregard the decision by the United Nations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
UNCOREDEMRETU;The United Nations Security Council is demanding we hand over one of our provinces to another country which has a claim on it. \n \nOut embassador in the United Nations has informed us that a vote has been carried out by the Security Council and as a result one of our territories is no longer considered to be a part of our country by the international community. \n \nOur government must decide how to respond to this demand by the Security Council. \n \nWe could submit to the vote of the Security Council and hand over the territory but this would cause an outrage domestically. \n \nWe may also choose to ingore this demand, but this will reduce our standing with the world powers. It will also reduce the neutrality of the country that requested our territory which could increase the chance they might attack us to reclaim it by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC3002;The security council has convened to decide whether to continue the Oil-for-Food programme in Iraq. \n \nThe Oil-for-Food Programme was instituted to relieve the extended suffering of civilians as the result of the comprehensive sanctions on Iraq from the UN, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. \n \nOil exported from Iraq was paid for by the recipient into an escrow account possessed until 2001 by BNP Paribas bank, rather than to the Iraqi government. The money was then apportioned to pay for war reparations to Kuwait, ongoing coalition and United Nations operations within Iraq. \n \nThe remainder, the majority of the revenue, was available to the Iraqi government to purchase regulated items.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The evidence contain images of mobile production facility for biological weapons as well as photos of terrorist training camps. \n \nIraq's alleged connection to Al-Qaeda is questionable since the regime of Saddam Hussein is a secular one and had for many decades clashed with religious circles, despite this the United States insists Iraq is working together with Al-Qaeda and has presented an emergency request to disarm the regime in Baghdad by force due to the fact that diplomacy has failed.  \n \nThe Security Council must decide how to respond to these allegations and should action be taken against Iraq.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

This action is viewed as formal recognition of these states by Georgia and the Security Council must decide what is the position of the UN on this matter. \n \nGeorgia's territorial integrity is in question and the recent declaration of independence by Kosovo has sparked a precedent for the Russian State Duma to follow and implement in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, if the resolution is adopted the UN will formally denounce the recognition by Russia and economic sanctions will be implemented against these states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC105;Our government has received a request for humanitarian and financial aid from the countries hit by the recent Indian Ocean Tsunami. \n \nThe devastation in these countries is massive and most do not have the means to rebuild and provide aid to the thousands of people affected by this disaster. We should consider helping these countries as it will benefit both them and our relationships diplomatic standing with them. \n \nSome of these countries could be useful allies in the future and we can be sure our help to them will not be quickly forgotten, we may also ask for certain privileges in case we decide on a larger aid package but this will lower the relation boost we get with these countries. \n \nIf we refuse to provide any aid to these countries it will lower our relations with them and could also cause an outrage at home due to the scale of this disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC106;The government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has pledged to provide a very generous amount to help us deal with the destruction caused by the recent Tsunami, for a price... \n \n$FROMCOUNTRY$ has asked to allow their troops passage through our territory, this might be a good deal for us and one which will help us to recover from the results of the Tsunami faster than our neighbours. \n \nOn the other hand allowing $FROMCOUNTRY$ access to our territory could mean trouble with our neighbours who would view this with suspicion. \n \nWe can either agree to these terms and take the money in exchange for the military access or condition this on them securing our independence in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME107;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Guarantee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC107;In response to our request to provide military access $FROMCOUNTRY$ has provided a request of their own. \n \nIt seems they are willing to grant us passage through their territory on the condition that we guarantee their safety, this will intimately bind our two nations together. If $FROMCOUNTRY$ is attacked by another country we will be called to join on their side and protect their independence. \n \nWhile this can be a good deal for both sides we should consider it carefully, if $FROMCOUNTRY$ has any potential enemies in the region they may try to use us as a shield and drag us into a war we did not intent to participate in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC109;Our main government held domestic and foreign stocks have fallen sharply! \n \nFollowing the economic crisis engulfing the United States government stocks all over the world are falling. It seems our own country is not safe from the financial storm and as a result many stocks and bonds held by our government have sharply decreased in their value. \n \nThe most obvious outcome of this is the fact that any revenue the government is making from these bonds and stocks has decreased sharply. \n \nOur financial institutions are attempting to minimize the damage but it seems that as long as the financial crisis worldwide is still in motion this is unlikely to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC110;We are experiencing a sharp downfall in our industrial output! \n \nDespite attempts by the government to weather the effects of the financial crisis industrial output and economic growth have fallen sharply, many industrial and commercial areas in our country are closing down or cutting down in their workforce, this may cause sharp unemployment and may lead to disorder. \n \nOutsourcing to other countries has also damaged our economy and with the economic storm still raging things are unlikely to change...It is advised we shift our focus to encouraging industry with government funds and investments before this situation is turned into a snowball and we lost control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC111;Our country credit rating has been lowered by a leading credit rating agency which has increased the cost at which we can borrow money. \n \nA credit rating is an evaluation of the credit worthiness of a debtor, especially a business (company) or a government, but not individual consumers. The evaluation is made by a credit rating agency of the debtor's ability to pay back the debt and the likelihood of default. Evaluations of individuals' credit worthiness are known as credit reporting and done by credit bureaus, or consumer credit reporting agencies, which issue credit scores. \n \nA poor credit rating indicates a credit rating agency's opinion that the company or government has a high risk of defaulting, based on the agency's analysis of the entity's history and analysis of long term economic prospects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC112;A major bank in our country has collapsed! \n \nThe collapse of the bank has caused a panic in the public and following the loss of trust in the economic system of our country turmoil is just around the corner. \n \nThe government must do whatever it can to stabilize the situation, cutting down in government or military spending may be necessary to keep the situation in control. \n \nIf steps are not taken immediately we could go into recession and will be forced to cut down in further areas of government or the military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000;The Millennium Summit was a meeting among many world leaders lasting three days from 6 September to 8 September 2000 at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Its purpose was to discuss the role of the United Nations at the turn of the 21st century. \n \nThis meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in history as of the year 2000. In this summit, 189 member states of the United Nations agreed to help citizens in the world's poorest countries to achieve a better life by the year 2015. The framework for this progress is outlined in the Millennium Development Goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC39001;The Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II was the international celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II to the thrones of seven countries. \n \nDespite the deaths of her sister, Princess Margaret, and mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in February and March 2002 respectively, and predictions in the media that the anniversary would be a non-event, the jubilee was marked with large-scale and popular events throughout London in June of the same year, bookended by events throughout the Commonwealth realms. \n \nQueen Elizabeth attended all of the official celebrations as scheduled, along with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. Over twelve months, the royal couple journeyed more than 40,000 miles (64,000 km) to the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, then around the United Kingdom, and wrapped up the jubilee year in Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC39002;The 7 July 2005 London bombings (often referred to as 7/7) were a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks in central London which targeted civilians using the public transport system during the morning rush hour. \n \nOn the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four Islamist extremists separately detonated three bombs in quick succession aboard London Underground trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. Fifty-two civilians were killed and over 700 more were injured in the attacks, the United Kingdom's worst terrorist incident since the 1988 Lockerbie bombing as well as the country's first ever suicide attack. \n \nThere have been various conspiracy theories proposed about the bombings, including the suggestion that the bombers were 'patsies', based on claims about timings of the trains and the train from Luton, supposed explosions underneath the carriages, and allegations of the faking of the one time-stamped and dated photograph of the bombers at Luton station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Bush was sworn in as president on January 20, 2001. Though he originally outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. \n \nWars were waged in Afghanistan and later Iraq while significant debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment of terrorist detainees took place within the United States. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6001;The Four Noes and One Without also known as the Four Noes was a pledge by President of the Republic of China Chen Shui-bian made in his inauguration speech on 20 May 2000, concerning the political status of Taiwan. \n \nThe pledge was that, provided the People's Republic of China has no intention to use military force against Taiwan, Chen's administration would not pursue Taiwanese independence.\n \nThe Four Noes and One Without were an important part of Republic of China-United States relations. Several times, Chen had to reassure the United States that the Four Noes and One Without policy had not been abolished and that he was not attempting to circumvent the pledge via any loopholes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6006;The September 11 attacks were a series of four coordinated suicide attacks upon the United States in New York City and the Washington, D.C. areas on September 11, 2001. On that Tuesday morning, 19 terrorists from the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda hijacked four passenger jets. The hijackers intentionally crashed two planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, both towers collapsed within two hours.\n \nConsidered by some as a false flag operation the September 11 attacks are a controversial event in American history. The proximity of the invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq and the passing of the USA PATRIOT act have raised concerns that the attacks were either known beforehand or even perpetrated by the US government to force the American people into submission which will allow the government to ristrict their daily freedoms and launch two controversial wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6008;The 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States occurred over the course of several weeks beginning on Tuesday, September 18, 2001. Letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two Democratic U.S. Senators, killing five people and infecting 17 others. \n \nAccording to the FBI, the ensuing investigation became "one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement." The anthrax attacks came in two waves. The first set of anthrax letters had a Trenton, New Jersey postmark dated September 18, 2001. \n \nFive letters are believed to have been mailed at this time to: ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the New York Post, all located in New York City and to the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. Robert Stevens, the first person who died from the mailings, worked at a tabloid called Sun. Two more anthrax letters, bearing the same Trenton postmark, were dated October 9, three weeks after the first mailing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6009;The USS Cole bombing was a suicide attack against the United States Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Cole (DDG-67) on 12 October 2000, while it was harbored and being refueled in the Yemeni port of Aden. 17 sailors were killed and 39 were injured in the blast. \n \nThe injured sailors were taken to the United States Army's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center near Ramstein, Germany, and later, back to the United States.\n \nThe attack was the deadliest against a U.S. naval vessel since the Iraqi attack on the USS Stark on 17 May 1987. The terrorist organization al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack. The American Navy has reconsidered their rules of engagement in response to this attack. \n \nWe can either repair the UUS Cole or we can scrap it to save the resources and money required for the repairs, scraping the ship will have a more negative effect on our national unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The U.S demanded from the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden and close all terrorist training camps, On 14 October 2001, the Taliban proposed to hand bin Laden over to a third country for trial, but only if they were given evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the events of 11 September 2001. The U.S. rejected this proposal and ensued with military operations.\n \nOperation Enduring Freedom began with the invasion of Afghanistan on October 7, 2001 as the armed forces of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth of Australia invaded Afghanistan with the stated goal of dismantling the al-Qaeda terrorist organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a base. The United States also said that it would remove the Taliban regime from power and create a viable democratic state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6011;The Taliban have refused to our five point demands, their leaders insist that they cannot hand over Osama Bin Laden to us before we give them evidence of Al Qaeda involvment in the September 11 attacks and the bombing of the USS cole. \n \nTheir support of Al Qaeda by means of training camps and equipment could mean further attacks against Americans in the United States and abroad, we must act now as we have pledged to do following the 9/11 attacks.\n \nOur wide military deployment should allow us easy deployment into Afghanistan, while the Afghani army is poorly armed it will provide resistence to our actions in the country. Our allies could join us in the war and we can count on the help of the United Kingdom and Austria to help us in the initial phase of the invasion. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC6013;From the mid-1980s, plans were put forward by James Watson, one of the two men who had made the seminal discovery of the structure of DNA to map the entire genome or genetic blueprint of the human species. The project officially began in 1990 and had teams working across the world. \n \nOn June 26 2000 two years ahead of schedule a "rough draft" was announced by Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. The draft covered perhaps 97 percent of around three billion chemical base pars that are assembled into some 20,000 genes bundled into the twenty-four chromosomes in every human cell to form the essential instructions for the building of a living body. \n \nThe complete genome has provided a wealth of data to aid scientists to study in far more detail the ineractions of genes and the ways in which they manifest in the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6014;Following the refusal by Saddam Hussein to go to exile the United States launched an invasion of Iraq dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom. \n \nThe invasion was preceded by an air strike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 19 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. \n \nWhile the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. \n \nThe invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies. Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6015;Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq has agreed that he steps down, he is to be replaced by one of his sons and the ruling Ba'ath party will remain in power. while this is an acceptance of our demands the situation in Iraq will not change much. \n \nWe can avoid a war and allow the ruling Saddam family to hold power but this will present a continuing threat to our forces and bases in the region, it may also hinder our progress in Afghanistan. We should decide what to do in reaction to this unanticipated move by the Iraqi regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6016;The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas and Louisiana as it reentered Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven crew members. \n \nDuring the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing. A few previous shuttle launches had seen minor damage from foam shedding, but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed. \nWhen Columbia reentered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and slowly break apart. \n \nAfter the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, similar to the aftermath of the Challenger disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6017;Major offensive operations in Afghanistan are over and both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda have suffered a blowing defeat from coalition forces. \n \nDespite this, the most wanted man in Afghanistan has managed to escape the forces of the coalition and escape into neighbouring Pakistan. The hunt for Bin Laden continues and will take part in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n \nAn enormous effort must now be done to restore order to Afghanistan and build from the ground up government institutions, this will be a difficult task in light of massive and brutal scope of the insurgency coalition forces will be facing from both Taliban and Al-Qaeda operatives who have refused to surrender and continue guerilla war against coalition forces. \n \nTheir numbers are strengthen by foreign fighters arriving in Afghanistan to fight a Jihad (holy war) just as it was during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6018;The 2003 Mission Accomplished speech gets its name from a banner that read "Mission Accomplished" displayed on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln during a televised address by United States President George W. Bush and the controversy that followed. \n \nPresident Bush stated at the time that this was the end to major combat operations in Iraq. Bush's assertion and the sign itself became controversial after guerrilla warfare in Iraq increased during the Iraqi insurgency. The vast majority of casualties, both military and civilian, occurred after the speech. \n \nSaddam Hussein has been removed from power but many areas in Iraq contain foreign and Al-Qaeda fighters that have called for a holy war against the United States and coalition forces just like they did in Afghanistan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6019;Hurricane Katrina was the eleventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the costliest natural disaster, as well as one of the five deadliest hurricanes, in the history of the United States. The storm is currently ranked as the third most intense United States landfalling tropical cyclone. \n \nOverall, at least 1,833 people died in the hurricane and subsequent floods, making it the deadliest United States hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Total property damage was estimated at $108 billion. \n \nThe criticisms of the government's response to Hurricane Katrina primarily consisted of criticism of mismanagement and lack of leadership in the relief efforts in response to the storm and its aftermath. More specifically, the criticism focused on the delayed response to the flooding of New Orleans, and the subsequent state of chaos in the Crescent City.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6020;Financial services firm Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \n \nThe filing remains the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, with Lehman holding over $600 billion in assets. \n \nLehman borrowed significant amounts to fund its investing in the years leading to its bankruptcy in 2008, a process known as leveraging or gearing. \n \nA significant portion of this investing was in housing-related assets, making it vulnerable to a downturn in that market. \n \nThe collapse of Lehman Brothers is largely seen as the catalyst to the 2008 world financial crisis and the subsequent Euro Debt Crisis...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC6021;The financial crisis of 2008  is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. \n \nIt threatened the collapse of large financial institutions, which was prevented by the bailout of banks by national governments, but stock markets still dropped worldwide. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. \n \nThe crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008–2012 global recession and contributing to the European sovereign-debt crisis. \n \nThe bursting of the U.S housing bubble, which peaked in 2004, caused the values of securities tied to U.S. real estate pricing to plummet, damaging financial institutions globally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC15005;Although many believe Hu was originally hand-picked by Deng as the youngest member of China's top leadership and a leading candidate to succeed Jiang, he had exercised a great deal of political skills between 1992 and 2002 to consolidate his position, and eventually emerged as Jiang's heir apparent in his own right. Hu also benefited from the slow but progressive institutionalization of power succession within the Party, something his predecessors lacked entirely. \n \nSince the early 1980s, the People's Republic of China has been marked by progressive institutionalization and rule by consensus, and moved away from the Maoist authoritarian model. \n \nMost external observers agree that Hu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

At least 11 schools were destroyed in the earthquake Over 85% of buildings in Gyegu, mostly of wood-earth construction, were destroyed, leaving hundreds trapped and thousands homeless. A vocational school collapsed and trapped many students. Power outage was also reported in Gyêgu. \n \nThe earthquake occurred in a Tibetan region in Qinghai province, where 93% of the local population is of Tibetan ethnicity, and many locals do not speak or understand Mandarin Chinese.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21000;The Treaty of Nice was signed by European leaders on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003. \n \nThe Treaty reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time. \n \nProponents of the Treaty claimed it was a utilitarian adjustment to cumbersome EU governing mechanisms and a required streamlining of the decision-making process, necessary to facilitate enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe. \n \nThey claim, that consequently, the treaty was vitally important for the integration and future progress of these former Eastern Bloc countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The treaty was signed on 16 April 2003 in Athens, Greece and it entered into force on 1 May 2004, resulting in enlargement of the European Union with 10 states. \n \nThe 2004 enlargement of the European Union was the largest single expansion of the European Union, in terms of territory, number of states, and population. However, it was not the largest in terms of gross domestic product. European leaders met in Dublin for fireworks and a flag-raising ceremony at Áras an Uachtaráin, the Irish presidential palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21002;The Treaty of Lisbon or Lisbon Treaty (initially known as the Reform Treaty) is an international agreement that amends the two treaties which form the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU). The Lisbon Treaty was signed by the EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009. It amends the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. \n \nIn this process, the Rome Treaty was renamed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Prominent changes included the move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in several policy areas in the Council of Ministers, a change in calculating such a majority to a new double majority, a more powerful European Parliament forming a bicameral legislature alongside the Council of ministers under the ordinary legislative procedure, a consolidated legal personality for the EU and the creation of a long-term President of the European Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21003;An emergency meeting of the European Union council has been called due to recent events in South Ossetia. \n \nThe Russian government has taken the unexpected step of incorporating South Ossetia into the Russian Federation, essentially annexing the former territory part of Georgia. \n \nSuch an aggressive move by Russia towards another European country demands a response from the European community as a whole. \n \nWestern members of the European union are insisting on imposing economic sanctions against both Russia and South Ossetia while Eastern members are suggesting a more careful approach towards the Russians which will not damage their own financial standings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21004;Following the recognition of South Ossetia by the United Nations Security Council the Euorpean Council must now decide how to respond to these events. \n \nUntil the recent resolution by the Security Council South Ossetia was considered as a territory part of Georgia and its government was not recognized by any other state. \n \nWith the recent recognition the situation in the region has changed and the EU may choose to follow the Security Council decision or reject the recognition which should send a powerful message to any country in the region which may want to challange the territorial integrity of European countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC23999;Vladimir Putin was inaugurated president on 7 May 2000. He appointed Minister of Finance Mikhail Kasyanov as his Prime minister. \n \nBetween 2000 and 2004, Putin set about reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs, reaching a 'grand-bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for – and alignment with – his government. \n \nPutin was criticized in the West and also by Russian liberals for what many observers considered a wide-scale crackdown on media freedom in Russia. \n \nDuring his first term in office, Putin moved to curb the political ambitions of some of the Yeltsin-era oligarchs, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

It took part in the naval exercises the navy was conducting at the Barents Sea and several of our ships have detected explosions near Kursk's last known location. \n \nThe submarine may have had some sort of an accident, the matter is being looked into by our top officers and as of now there does not seem to be a reason to worry, the Kursk after all is an unsinkable submarine. \n \nNews of the incident have already started spreading across the nation and abroad as well as various conspiracy theories. We should issue a statement regarding the issue to calm down the population and bring an end to the wild speculation that is going about, this issue will be dealt with swiftly so there is no need for panic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24002;Mr President, \n \nWe are continuing the rescue attempts of the Kursk and its crew, the situation is under control. Despite the rumours that have been going all over the country the Kursk nearly had a malfunction. \n \nDespite this, the media seem to have a different interpretation of events and are demanding you return to Moscow from your vacation in Sochi to assume command of the rescue operations. \n \nAlso, we have received offers of assistance from several countries such the USA, Norway and the United Kingdom but at this point the head of our Northern Fleet Admiral Popov insists we do not require any outside involvement, accepting such help will make the government and Russia look weak in the eyes of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24003;Mr President, \n \nDespite our best efforts the rescue and recovery operations we have attempted have failed. By now we can assume the crew is dead and the public is even more enraged by the fact we have rejected foreign aid. \n \nA British recovery vessel and Norwegian divers are on standby near the Kursk's location to begin recovery operations, perhaps it is time to allow them to access the submarine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24004;Mr President, \n \nOur divers have entered the submarine after the Norwegian divers cut the hull section leading to the compartment nine where crew members of the Kursk are belived to be residing. \n \nIt seems all crew members have perished due to a fire which took over the submarine, some are burned so bad it is impossible to identify them. Our divers have removed all sensitive information and recovered the ship's log but for now we will have to suspend the operation due to extreme weather. \n \nAll that remains now is to decide what to do with the remains of the Kursk. Recovering a submarine of this size is a very costly operation but could lift the spirits of the nation and allow us to put a proper end to this incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24005;President Putin met with about 400-600 angry and grief-filled residents of the Vidyayevo navy base and about 350 family members of the Kursk's crew. \n \nDuring the meeting, Nadezhda Tylik, the mother of Kursk submariner Lt. Sergei Tylik, was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting. She harangued Putin and Deputy Prime Minister Klebanov, accusing them of lying to the family members. \n \nWhen she would not be quiet, a woman in civilian apparel behind her forcibly injected her through her clothing with a sedative. Tylik later stated, "The injection was done to shut my mouth. Immediately after it I just lost the ability to speak and was carried out." \n \nThe whole scene was captured by a TV crew, although it was not televised within Russia. The rest of the world was able to see officials remove her from the meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24006;Mr President, \n \nIgor Sergeyev the minister of defence has placed a resignation request due to the recents events involving the Kursk disaster. \n \nWhile he is an efficient leader keeping him at his post could cause an outrage by the public which expects some kind of measures and responsibility to be taken from members of the cabinet. \n \nIt would also be wise for his replacement not to be from the ranks of the military since the military has a really bad reputation in the eyes of the public for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24007;The Russian government committed to raising the wreck in a 65M salvage operation. It became the largest salvage operation of its type ever accomplished. On 8 October 2001, fourteen months after the disaster, they raised the remainder of the submarine. Once the sub was raised it was carried back under the barge to the Russian Navy's Roslyakovo Shipyard in Murmansk where the submarine was cut up for scrap. \n \nAn official investigation after most of the wreck was raised along with analysis of pieces of debris concluded that a faulty weld in the casing of the practice torpedo caused high-test peroxide to leak, which caused the kerosene fuel to explode. The initial explosion destroyed the torpedo room, severely damaged the control room, incapacitated or killed the control room crew, and caused the submarine to sink. The fire resulting from this explosion in turn triggered the detonation of between five and seven torpedo warheads after the submarine had struck bottom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24008;On 1 December 2001, Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov presented a preliminary report to President Putin. Ustinov wrote that the entire military exercise the Kursk was part of had been "poorly organized" and that the probe had revealed "serious violations by both Northern Fleet chiefs and the Kursk crew." \n \nShortly afterward, Putin transferred the Northern Fleet commander, Vyacheslav Popov, and his chief of staff, Admiral Mikhail Motsak. Popov and Motsak had championed the story that the accident had been caused by a collision with a NATO submarine. When Putin dismissed them, he made a point of repudiating the collision theory. \n \nPutin dismissed the Northern Fleet's submarine commander, Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev,  and in total removed 12 high-ranking officers in charge of the Northern Fleet. Paradoxically, he said their dismissal had nothing to do with the Kursk disaster,but that they had been responsible for "serious flaws in the organizations of the service.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24009;To: Foreign Minister of $COUNTRY$ \n \nWe appreciate your offer to help us in the rescue attempts of the Kursk but be sure the Russian navy is more than capable to deal with this incident. Despite of what you may have been led to believe the Kursk nearly had a malfunction. \n \nWe have established communications with the crew, water and oxygen are being supplied to them. At this time there is no need for any outside involvement with the rescue operations and the brave Russian northern fleet rescue teams are more than capable to finish rescue operations on their own. \n \n Sincerely, \n \nNorthern Fleet Admiral Popov.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24010;We have received an urgent request of assistance from our partners in Ukraine led by President Leonid Kuchma and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych who is nominated for the upcoming presidental election. \n \nIt seems that European and American influence is growing in the country and several opposition parties have initiated action to topple the current regime in Kiev. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union there was a Russian friendly regime in Kiev and it seems now forces within and outside of Ukraine are attempting to change this. \n \nWe must decide on how to react to this before it is too late, if we allow an anti Russian party to come to power in Ukraine we could lose the influence we have there and further loss of influence in Ukraine could lead the country to join the European Union and NATO.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24011;The war in Chechnya and large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased but daily attacks continue particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya, spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus as well. \n \nTypically, small separatist units target Russian and pro-Russian officials, security forces, and military and police convoys and vehicles. The separatist units employ improvised explosive devices and sometimes group up for larger raids. Russian forces then retaliate with artillery and air strikes, as well as counter-insurgency operations. \n \nRussia has recovered from a deadly war and a national embarrassment when a military stalemate had occured in the First Chechen War and Russia was forced withdraw troops from Chechnyato and sign a ceasefire as part of the Khasavyurt Accord.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24012;The Beslan School Mssacre started on 1 September 2004, lasted three days and involved the capture of over 1,100 people as hostages (including 777 children), ending with the death of 385 people. \n \nThe crisis began when a group of armed Islamic separatist militants, mostly Ingush and Chechen, occupied School Number One in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia. \n \nThe hostage-takers were the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion, sent by the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, who demanded recognition of the independence of Chechnya at the UN and Russian withdrawal from Chechnya. \n \nThe attack at Beslan was met with international abhorrence and universal condemnation, while countries and charities around the world donated to funds set up to assist the families and children that were involved in the Beslan crisis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24013;The remains of the former Russian Tsar Nicholas II that were found in 1991 have been identified. \n \nNicholas II ruled from 1 November 1894 until his forced abdication on 15 March 1917. His reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. Political enemies nicknamed him Nicholas the Bloody because of the Khodynka Tragedy, anti-Semitic pogroms, Bloody Sunday, his violent suppression of the 1905 Revolution, his execution of political opponents and his perceived responsibility for the Russo-Japanese War. \n \nNicholas II, his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna. his son, Alexei Nikolaevich. his four daughters, Olga Nikolaevna, Tatiana Nikolaevna, Maria Nikolaevna and Anastasia Nikolaevna were executed by the Bolsheviks on the night of 16/17 July 1918.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24014;The Russian State Duma (The Russian Parliament) has adopted a resolution which calls on the Russian president and government to consider the recognition of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \n \nThis may be an opportunity for us to improve our relations with both of these regions that have been de facto separate from Georgia, no doubt a recognition of their independence will strengthen trade relations between our two countries. \n \nHowever, such a recognition will not be viewed well in both Georgia and the Western countries. These two republics have no international recognition and by improving relations with them we might damage relations with other Western countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24015;Mr President, \n \nFollowing the interception of a Georgian unmanned unarmed aerial vehicle over the territory of Abkhazia the Georgian military has increased its presence in the area. \n \nGeorgian troops are amassing on the border with Abkhazia in a clear act of provocation meant to trigger a response from Russia. We don't know if this is a temporary measure or a permanent re-basing of their troops but we should be ready in case they decide to attack us or Abkhazia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24016;A proclamation has been issued by the president of South Ossetia \n \nIn response to the recent events in Abkhazia and South Ossetia the president of Republic of North Ossetia Taymuraz Mamsurov has issued a statement asking Russia and other countries in the region to reunite North and South Ossetia. \n \nNo doubt such a statement at these times will have an effect on our relations with our neighbours and the world but perhaps this is the perfect time to initiate a move in this direction. \n \nSupporting the move will probably raise tenstions with Georgia but our relations are already at an all time low so consequences should be minimal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24017;Mr President, \n \nGeorgia has decided to drop its claims to the region of South Ossetia. \n \nThese are great news that will no doubt ease tensions in the region and reduce foreign pressure on Russia and South Ossetia. We could take this opportunity to finish what we started and incorporate South Ossetia into the Russian Federation, after dropping its claims over the region Georgia will not have a legitimate reason to object to this move. \n \nHowever, we should consider the response of the international community, annexing more territory into the Russian Federation could raise a few eyebrows in the West and may cause concerns that could lead to tensions with our Western neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24018;Mr President, \n \nGeorgia has requested that we respond to a recent flyby of our military jets over South Ossetia, It seems this act has stirred up great resentment in Tbilisi and an official explanation is demanded by the Georgian government. \n \nWe have received the proper authorization to fly over the area from our partners in South Ossetia so there was no violation of international law, maybe its time we cool down some hot heads in Tbilisi. \n \nThe recent build up of forces near the South Ossetia border is of much concern and our reconnaissance flight has proved that the Georgian military is indeed building up its forces in the area...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24019;Mr President, \n \nOur mighty army has pushed back the invading Georgian army from South Ossetia and the population welcomes our soldiers as liberators, some ministers in the cabinet as well as military figures have suggested that perhaps this is a good time to make a strong diplomatic move. \n \nWe could use this chance to incorporate South Ossetia to prevent any further attacks or encroachment on this territory by Georgia or NATO forces in the future. This will however likely to cause an uproan and a response from the Security Council which will see this move as a hostile land grab considering South Ossetia is regarded as part of Georgia by international law. \n \nThe alternative is to return the situation to the pre-war condition or a similar one but with access for our military which will remain to defend the area against any future threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24020;Mr President, \n \nAlthough the war in South Ossetia has ended forces from the Republic of Abkhazia and Russian troops still remain in the Kodori Valley region of Georgia. \n \nWe need to decide what to do about this peace of land, if we decide to keep the region it will have to be transferred to our Abkaz allies who lay claims to it... this will also mean the expulsion of thousands of Georgians currently living there. \n \nOn the other hand we could return the are to the control of the Georgian government, this may be a good step for a future rebuilding of relatins between our two countries. \n \nMilitary advisor's are pointing our that the valley is of much strategical importance so giving it up could be a mistake in the long run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC24021;United Russia was founded in December 2001 through a merger of the Unity and Fatherland – All Russia parties. \n \nWhile Unity had initially had only one narrow purpose, limited only to the 1999 Duma elections, after the victory state officials began to transform the party into a permanent one. A large number of independent deputies who had been elected to the Duma were invited to join the party's delegation. \n \nOn April 2001, OVR and Unity leaders issued a joint declaration that they had started the process of unification. In July 2001, the unified party, called "Union of Unity and Fatherland" held its founding congress, and in December 2001, it became "All-Russian Party of Unity and Fatherland", or more commonly, United Russia. \n \nThis new united party will give us much greater control over all aspects of the country with legitimacy from the Russian people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC33000;In the 2004 South American Summit, representatives of twelve South American nations signed the Cuzco Declaration, a two-page letter of intent announcing the establishment of the then-named "South American Community of Nations". \n \nThe leaders announced the intention of modeling the new community in the mold of the European Union, including a unified passport, a parliament and, eventually, a single currency. \n \nThe then Secretary General of the Andean Community Allan Wagner speculated that an advanced union such as the EU should be possible within the next fifteen years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30000;The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred on 26 December with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The event is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake. \n \nThe undersea megathrust earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing 230,000 people in 14 countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 metres (100 ft) high. \n \nIt was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. \n \nThe plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response. In all, the worldwide community donated more than $14 billion in humanitarian aid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30001;The 29 October 2005 Delhi bombings occurred on 29 October 2005 in Delhi, India, killing 62 people and injuring at least 210 others in three explosions. \n \nThe bombings came only two days before the important festival of Diwali, which is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains. The bombs were triggered in two markets in central and south Delhi and in a bus in the Govindpuri area in the south of the city. \n \nIndian investigators believe the Kashmir separatist/ Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba was behind the attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC282000;The Bonn Agreement  was the initial series of agreements intended to re-create the State of Afghanistan following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Since no nationally-agreed-upon government had existed in Afghanistan since 1979, it was felt necessary to have a transition period before a permanent government was established. A nationally-agreed-upon government would require at least one loya jirga to be convened. \n \nHowever, in the absence of law and order in the wake of the rapid victory of American and Afghan Northern Alliance forces, immediate steps were felt to be required. \n \nIn December' 2001, 25 prominent Afghans met under UN auspices in Bonn, Germany, to decide on a plan for governing the country. As a result, the Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) - made up of 30 members. The Conference chose Hamid Karzai, who was subsequently elected President in 2004.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC42000;On 21 September 2001, a huge explosion occurred in the AZF fertiliser factory in Toulouse, France, belonging to the Grande Paroisse branch of the Total group. Three hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate was stored (the maximum capacity was 2,000 tonnes) in the hangar #221. The whole factory was destroyed making a crater of depth 20 to 30 m (65 to 100 ft), with a diametre of 200 m (650 ft). \n \nThe blast measured 3.4 on the Richter scale, with an estimated power equivalent to 20-40 tons of TNT. Police at first believed that at least five bombs had simultaneously gone off. There is still controversy over the exact number of explosions. The disaster caused 29 deaths (28 from the factory, 1 secondary school pupil from a neighbouring school), 2,500 seriously wounded, and 8,000 light casualties. Two thirds of the city's windows were shattered, causing 70 eye wounds and several thousand wounds which had to be sutured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC42001;Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde is a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet airliner that was operated until 2003. It featured a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2.04 \n \nConcorde was jointly developed and produced by Aérospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Concorde's name reflects the development agreement between the United Kingdom and France. \n \nOn 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced that they would retire Concorde later that year. They cited low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, the slump in air travel following the September 11, 2001 attacks, and rising maintenance costs. \n \nAlthough Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s, 30 years later, its analogue cockpit was dated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC48000;The funeral of Pope John Paul II was held on 8 April 2005, six days after his death on 2 April. The funeral was followed by the novemdiales devotional in which the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches observe nine days of mourning. \n \nPope John Paul's funeral brought together what was, at the time, the single largest gathering in history of heads of state outside the United Nations, surpassing the funeral of Winston Churchill. Four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers, and more than 14 leaders of other religions attended, alongside the faithful. It is likely to have been one of the largest single gathering of Christianity in history, with numbers estimated in excess of four million mourners gathering in Rome. \n \nJohn Paul II is recognised as helping to end Communist rule in his native Poland and eventually all of Europe and significantly improved the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism and Islam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Some of the largest protests took place in Europe. The protest in Rome involved around three million people, and is listed in the 2004 Guinness Book of World Records as the largest anti-war rally in history. \n \nAt the time, many commentators were hopeful that this global mobilization of unprecedented scale would stop the coming Iraq war. New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were "two superpowers on the planet - the United States, and worldwide public opinion". The potential effect of the protests was generally dismissed by pro-war politicians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC78000;The 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake (also known as the Bantul earthquake) occurred on May 27 2006 with a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum intensity of IX (Destructive) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. \n \nThe shock occurred on the southern coast of Java near the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, and caused a disproportionate number of casualties, with more than 5,700 deaths and 37,000 injuries, and financial losses of 29 Trillion. \n \nThe eruption of Mount Merapi, a stratovolcano that was entering a period of unrest, was originally thought to have a connection with the earthquake. With a lack of instruments in the area, the shock was initially attributed with the Opak Fault that lies to the east of the affected areas, but later InSAR analysis revealed that another previously unknown fracture was responsible for the sequence of shocks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

If we do not accept these demands the United States has threatened to use force against us. \n \nWe must decide quickly what to do, it is most likely that if you refuse to go to exile the Americans and their allies will attack. \n \nIf you decide to leave power it would be best to appoint one of your sons to the top position of the country to keep the party and the people calm as much as possible. \n \nBoth Qusay and Uday will be accepted as legitimate leaders but Uday has a lower reputation with the people and might not be accepted as well as Qusay.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC342000;The United States has began operation Iraqi Freedom and we have received a request from the American government to take part in the operation. \n \nWhile the current regime in Baghdad is not the most friendly towards the Kurdish aspirations for an independent country going to war against it is an entirely different matter. \n \nOne option is to tell the Americans we do not wish to take part in this operation at all. \n \nAnother option is to allow American and coalition troops passage but not take part in the fighting. \n \nA third option is to declare war on Iraq and take full part in the operation. This could be a good opportunity for us to reclaim areas which we have demanded for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC369000;The Nepalese royal massacre occurred on Friday, June 1, 2001, at a house in the grounds of the Narayanhity Royal Palace, then the residence of the Nepalese monarchy, when the heir to the throne, Prince Dipendra killed nine members of his family and himself. \n \nThe dead included King Birendra of Nepal and Queen Aiswarya, Dipendra's father and mother. Prince Dipendra became de jure King of Nepal upon his father's death and died whilst in a coma three days after the act. However, there are claims that Dipendra was already dead before being declared as the King. His uncle Gyanendra then became king. \n \nWhile Dipendra lived, Gyanendra maintained that the deaths were the result of an "accidental discharge of an automatic weapon". However, he later said that he made this claim due to "legal and constitutional hurdles", since under the constitution, and by tradition, Dipendra could not have been charged with murder had he survived.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC369001;The events surrounding the Royal Massacre on 1 June 2001 have proved very controversial in the country. \n \nA two-man investigation team appointed by Gyanendra, and made up of Keshav Prasad Upadhaya, then Supreme Court Chief Justice, and Taranath Ranabhat, then speaker of the House of Representatives, carried out a week-long investigation. \n \nAfter interviewing more than 100 people including eyewitnesses, palace officials, guards, and staff, they concluded that, indeed, Crown Prince Dipendra had carried out the massacre, but did not draw any further conclusions. \n \nAs his nephew lay in a coma, Gyanendra was named regent, but following Dipendra's death on 4 June 2001, Gyanendra ascended the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In total a reported 44 countries sent in personnel to assist in relief operations and 60 countries offered assistance. \n \nFollowing the earthquake, the Iranian government seriously considered moving the capital of Tehran in fear of an earthquake occurring there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC156000;Halonen announced in 1999 that she wished to stand as a candidate for President in the 2000 Presidential elections. She was a surprising candidate as she didn't represent many traditional values: She was known as a left-wing social democratic party member, who lived in a domestic partnership, was a single parent and had resigned from the national church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. \n \nWhile Halonen started from fourth place in the presidential election polls, surprisingly in the first round of the elections she got the most votes, 40.0%. Since neither of the two candidates got over 50% of the votes, a second round was held as required by Finnish Law. \n \nIn the second round, Halonen narrowly defeated her opponent with 51.6% against 48.4% thus becoming Finland's first female President. Her first term began on 1 March 2000.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC183000;As early as the mid-eighties, a group of gay rights activists, headed by Henk Krol – the editor-in-chief of the Gay Krant – asked the government to allow same sex couples to marry. Parliament decided in 1995 to create a special commission, which was to investigate the possibility of same-sex marriages. At that moment, the Christian Democrats (Christian Democratic Appeal) were not part of the ruling coalition for the first time since the introduction of full democracy. \n \nThe special commission finished its work in 1997 and concluded that civil marriage should be extended to include same-sex couples. he marriage bill passed the House of Representatives by 109 votes to 33. The law came into effect on 1 April 2001, and on that day four same-sex couples were married by the Mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen who became a registrar specifically to officiate at the weddings. A few months earlier, Mayor Cohen had been junior Minister of Justice of the Netherlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC261000;Kosovo has declared its independence from Serbia, while this declaration has little international recognition and meaning it is no doubt another peace in the dissolution of the Serbian state. \n \nOur government must now decide how to react to this event, if we choose to act we will have to be quick since time will only incresae the legitimacy of the government in Pristina. \n \nWe are in a difficult position since the 90's Kosovo war has proven that the European Union and Nato will not allow us to take Kosovo by force but perhaps we should try. \n \nThis will however damage our relations with members of the European Union and will not doubt slow down our accession into the European union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231000;The Rose Revolution was a change of power in Georgia in November 2003, which took place after widespread protests over the disputed parliamentary elections. As a result, President Eduard Shevardnadze was forced to resign on November 23, 2003. \n \nMany countries watched Georgia transition from an autocracy to a democracy, but the key players were primarily Russia and the United States. \nRussia was suspected of being involved in Georgia’s affairs from the beginning as it was assumed to have been involved in various coup and assassination attempts of Shevardnadze. \n \nThe United States felt the revolution was a good opportunity to make a serious attempt in the establishment of democracy not only in Georgia, but the region it was in. The U.S. Agency for International Development was reported to have spent $1.5 million on modernizing Georgia’s voting system. They also invested in 3,000 election observers throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231005;We have been informed by the Russian foreign minister that they have decided to recognize the independence of the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \n \nThis is a terrible blow to our efforts to isolate the rebels that have gained their de-facto independence from Georgia and we must decide how to respond to these hostile acts by Russia. \n \nA direct confrontation is an option but it will no doubt drag Russia in and our military may not be able to resist the Russian forces long enough to hold these regions. \n \nWe can also submit to the Russian decision and accept the fact these regions are lost for good, this may help to ease tensions but will have a devastating effect at home since many Georgians consider Abkhazia and South Ossetia part of Georgia. \n \nAnother option is to submit a formal complaint to the United Nations Security council and see if diplomatic pressure from bigger and stronger powers may cause Russia to change its course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231006;There have been a few incidents in recent days in which our unmanned aerial drones were attacked and intercepted. \n \nA footage of one of these interceptions has been presented to the government, it shows a jet fighter which is most probably a MiG-29 intercepting our Israeli-made Hermes 450. \n \nRussia is the only country in the region that owns jet fighters of this kind, it is clear that our unmanned unarmed aerial vehicle was intercepted by a Russian jet fighter. \n \nIt is now up to the government to decide to to react to this situation as it is a clear violation of our sovereignty considering the fact the UAV was patrolling over our territory and did not enter Russian air space.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231007;The Russian republic of North Ossetia has issused a statement asking all countries in the region to help with the unification of South Ossetia with North Ossetia. \n \nThe immediate meaning of such a step is the incorporation of South Ossetia into the Russian Federation, if this happens we will lose any chance of getting South Ossetia back and maintaining Georgia's territorial integrity. \n \nThe government must decide how to respond to this statement which comes at at a very tense times and could be the trigger which could lead to a greater conflict in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231008;Our intelligence has an urgent report on the situation in South Ossetia. \n \nIt seems Russian aggression in the region is growing daily and we have spotted a number of Russian war planes over the breakaway region. The military is not sure about their purpose but it would be logical to assume they were there to gather intelligence on our positions in the area in preparation for an attack. \n \nWe must send a clear message to Moscow that such and act will note be tolerated, South Ossetia is by all rights a territory of Georgia and no Russian presence can be accepted without us knowing about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231009;We have just received the response from our embassy in Russia regarding the recent Russian provocation in South Ossetia. \n \nIt seems their intent with the military flyby was to "let hot heads in Tbilisi cool down". Such a response shows great disrespect to our leadership and the territorial integrity of Georgia. \n \nWe must now decide how to respond to this, we could let this incident slide but this could show weakness towards the Russians and may trigger further incidents. \n \nWe may also choose a diplomatic approach and recall our ambassador to Russia to show we do not appreciate this kind of provocation and make a firm stand. \n \nAs a last resort we can try to recapture the area to avoid any such incidents in the future but it could trigger a responce from Russia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231010;Urgent news from South Ossetia. \n \nIt seems the South Ossetian separatists have begun a campaign of terror against the Georgian civilian population in the area, they are shelling villages and driving people out of the area. \n \nThis is most likely an attempt by the illegitimate government to expand its control, there are also rumours that Russian troops have joined their ranks and are supporting these atrocities committed by the separatists. \n \nWe must react quickly before the situation gets out of control, the military is ready to take on these terrorists and perhaps this is a good opportunity to finally show these war mongers that their actions have consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC231011;The United Nations Security Council has recognized the independence of South Ossetia. \n \nIt is unclear what drove the Security Council for such a decisions but no doubt Russian pressure and capital had something to do with it, we must now decide how to react to this new reality. \n \nUp until now South Ossetia war considered part of Georgia but this is no longer the case, if we take the territory by force it will not be recognized as part of our country. \n \nOn the other hand, we could just let go of South Ossetia and let seperate their destiny from our own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC264000;In the five-man presidential election race held on 24 September 2000, incumbent president  Miloševic was defeated in the first round. The election was won by the opposition leader Koštunica, who won slightly more than 50 percent of votes. Initially refusing to acquiesce, Miloševic had to concede defeat amidst street protests. Miloševic's rejection of claims of a first-round opposition victory in new elections for the Federal parliament and presidency in September 2000 led to mass demonstrations in Belgrade on 5 October, known as the Bulldozer Revolution. \n \nMiloševic was forced to accept this when commanders of the army whom he had expected to support him had indicated that in this instance they would not, and would permit the violent overthrow of the Serbian government. On 6 October, Miloševic met with Democratic Opposition of Serbia's presidential candidate leader Vojislav Koštunica and publicly accepted defeat. Koštunica finally took office as Yugoslav president on 7 October following Miloševic's announcement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC264001;Miloševic was indicted in May 1999, during the Kosovo War, by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for crimes against humanity in Kosovo. Charges of violating the laws or customs of war, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions in Croatia and Bosnia and genocide in Bosnia were added a year and a half later. \n \nMiloševic, while defending himself, read from Friedrich Naumann's book Mitteleuropa, claiming it was a long-standing objective of German foreign policy and the German liberal party in particular to "erase Serbia from the map", citing a number of alleged wrongdoings by Germany against Serbia during the last hundred years, including the recognition of Croatia and other countries. \n \nHe pointed out that Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister who proposed the creation of the tribunal, was a German liberal. In particular, he emphasized statements by Kinkel that Germany had to accomplish in Yugoslavia what it had "failed to accomplish twice before".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC264002;Following the alarming reports coming from Kosovo our government has to decide on a course of action. \n \nSerb population all over Kosovo is under threat and many communities are still under threat, the people of Serbia demand us to act. \n \nWe can demand from the UN to allow us access to Kosovo to restore the peace but this could greatly upset Albania and it is unlikely such a request will be accepted considering our history in Kosovo. \n \nWe can enter our troops into Kosovo without UN approval but this could lead to a hostile response from both the UN and Albania. \n \nWe can also choose to only condemn the violence but this will upset our population at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC264003;Montenegro, a state in the union of Serbia-Montenegro has declared its independence following a referendum. \n \nThis is a difficult time for Serbia and its territorial integrity which has been challenged again and again in the last few decades. We must now decide how to respond to the proclamation by the parliment of Montenegro. \n \nLosing Montenegro would mean losing our only access to the Adriatic sea and turning Serbia into a landlocked country. We could reject this decision by Montenegro but any hostile acts by us against another Balkan country will be viewed and most probably responded with hostility from the UN and the European Union. \n \nA declaration of independence in Montenegro may also speed up a similar process in Kosovo, while we do not control Kosovo directly it is probably for the best if it doesn't come under the influence of neighbouring Albania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC270000;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider, the largest, most complex experimental facility ever built, and the largest single machine in the world. \n \n It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. \n \nThe LHC's aim is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics, high-energy physics and in particular, to further test the properties of the Higgs boson and the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories, and other unsolved questions of physics, advancing human understanding of physical laws. \n \n§B(All European countries who are part of the EU will recieve a bonus to their research points)§b;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC207000;The United Nations Security Council has decided not to act in responce to the aggression by Serbia in Kosovo. \n \nWe must decide what to do now after the world has abandoned our Albanian brothers in Kosovo, it would be unthinkable to allow Serbia to regain control of Kosovo after it was finally back in Albanian hands. \n \nWe can intervene in the conflict on the side of Kosovo and push back the Serbian military but it would be a costly war and our army is not at its best shape right now. \n \nWe may also choose not to take part in this conflict but it would be regarded as treason by our brothers in Kosovo who will probably flee into Albania and our own people at home. \n \nPerhaps we should consider arming the Albanian opposition in Kosovo and contribute to the conflict in this indirect way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC330000;On 20 September 2001 the US declared that Al Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden were behind the September 11 attacks and presented a five point ultimatum to the Taliban government in Afghanistan: \n \n 1. Deliver to the U.S. all of the leaders of al-Qaeda. \n \n 2. Release all imprisoned foreign nationals. \n \n 3. Close immediately every terrorist training camp. \n \n 4. Hand over every terrorist and their supporters to appropriate authorities. \n \n 5. Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection. \nIf the Taliban will refuse to these demands the US will use force to fulfil them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC333000;Ahmad Shah Massoud was an Afghan political and military leader, who was a powerful military commander during the resistance against the Soviet occupation between 1979 and 1989 and in the following years of civil war. He was assassinated on September 9, 2001. \n \nMassoud, then aged 48, was the target of a suicide attack at Khwaja Bahauddin, in Takhar Province in northeastern Afghanistan on September 9, 2001. The attackers claimed to be Belgians originally from Morocco. Their passports turned out to be stolen and their nationality was later determined to be Tunisian. \n \nThe assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the September 11 attacks in 2001 on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3,000 people. It appeared to have been the major terrorist attack which Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336002;The Versailles wedding hall, located in Talpiot, Jerusalem, is the site of the worst civil disaster in Israel's history. At 22:43 on May 24, 2001, during the wedding of Keren and Asaf Dror, a large portion of the third floor of the four-story building collapsed. \n \nAs a result, 23 people fell to their deaths through two stories, including the groom's 80-year-old grandfather and his three-year-old second cousin, the youngest victim. Another 380 were injured, including the bride who suffered serious pelvic injuries that required surgery. \n \nThe disaster shocked the Israeli public not only because it was one of the worst building disasters in the country's history, but because the event was documented on a camcorder and broadcast on local and international television. Following the disaster, the "Versailles Law" was passed by the Parliament of Israel. This law established a special committee responsible for treating the people injured in the disaster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336003;The Dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing was a terrorist attack on June 1, 2001 in which a suicide bomber named Saeed Hotari, a millitant linked to the Palestinian group Hamas, blew himself up outside a discotheque on a beachfront in Tel Aviv, Israel, killing 21 Israeli teenagers and injuring 132. \n \nSuicide bomber Saeed Hotari was standing in line on a Friday night in front of the Dolphinarium, when the area was packed with youngsters (most of them Russian new arrivals) waiting for admission. \n \nSurvivors of the attack later described how the young Palestinian bomber appeared to taunt his victims before the explosion, wandering among them dressed in clothes that led some to mistake him for an orthodox Jew from Asia, and banging a drum packed with explosives and ball bearings, while repeating the words in Hebrew: "Something's going to happen".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336004;On September 28, Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon together with a Likud party delegation visited the Temple Mount. Sharon was only permitted to enter the compound after the Israeli Interior Minister had received assurances from the Palestinian Authority's security chief that no problems would arise if he made the visit. \n \nShortly after Sharon left the site, angry demonstrations by Palestinian Jerusalemites outside erupted into rioting. Israeli police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, while protesters hurled stones and other missiles, injuring 25 policemen, of whom one was seriously injured and had to be taken to hospital. At least three Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets. \n \nThe stated purpose for Sharon's visit of the compound was to assert the right of all Israelis to visit the Temple Mount, According to The New York Times, many in the Arab world point to Sharon's visit as the beginning of the Second Intifada and derailment of the peace process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336005;The Second Intifada, also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada was the second Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation – a period of intensified Israeli-Palestinian violence. \n \nIt started in September 2000, when Ariel Sharon made a visit to the Temple Mount, seen by Palestinians as highly provocative. In protest Palestinian demonstrators, throwing stones at police, were dispersed by the Israeli army, using tear gas and rubber bullets. \n \nBoth parties caused high numbers of casualties among civilians as well as combatants: the Palestinians by numerous suicide bombing and gunfire. The Israelis by tank and gunfire and air attacks, by numerous targeted killings, and by harsh reactions on demonstrations. The death toll, including both military and civilian, is estimated to be about 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336006;In July 1999, Ehud Barak became Israel's Prime Minister, promising Israel would unilaterally withdraw from Lebanon to the international border by July 2000. During the spring of 2000, Hezbollah operations stepped up considerably, with persistent harassment of Israeli military outposts in occupied Lebanese territory. As preparation for the major withdrawal plan, Israeli forces began abandoning several forward positions within the security zone of South Lebanon. \n \nOn 24 May, Israel announced that it would withdraw all troops from South Lebanon. All Israeli forces had withdrawn from Lebanon by the end of the next day, more than six weeks before its stated deadline of 7 July. The Israeli pullout resulted in the collapse of the SLA and the rapid advance of Hezbollah forces into the area. This withdrawal was widely considered a victory for Hezbollah and boosted its popularity in Lebanon. By ending the occupation, Barak's cabinet assumed it would improve its worldwide image. Ehud Barak has argued that "Hezbollah would have enjoyed international legitimacy in their struggle against a foreign occupier", if the Israelis had not withdrew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336007;The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas and Louisiana as it reentered Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven crew members including the first Israeli astronaut colonel Ilan Ramon. \n \nDuring the launch of STS-107, Columbia's 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the left wing. A few previous shuttle launches had seen minor damage from foam shedding, but some engineers suspected that the damage to Columbia was more serious. NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed. \n \nWhen Columbia reentered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and slowly break apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC336008;Ariel Sharon was hospitalized on December 18, 2005, after suffering a minor ischemic stroke. During his hospital stay, doctors discovered a heart defect requiring surgery and ordered bed rest pending a cardiac catheterization scheduled for January 5, 2006. Instead, Sharon immediately returned to work and suffered a hemorrhagic stroke on January 4, the day before surgery. After two surgeries lasting 7 and 14 hours, doctors stopped the bleeding in Sharon's brain, but were unable to prevent him from entering into a coma. \n \nEhud Olmert became Acting Prime Minister the night of Sharon's second stroke, while Sharon was only officially in office. Knesset elections followed in March, with Olmert and Sharon's Kadima party winning a plurality. \n \nThe next month, the Israeli Cabinet declared Sharon permanently incapacitated and Olmert officially became Interim Prime Minister in office on April 14, 2006 until his new established government made him Prime Minister in his own right on 4 May.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC339000;The 2005 Amman bombings were a series of coordinated bomb attacks on three hotel lobbies in Amman, Jordan, on 9 November 2005. \n \nThe three hotels are often frequented by foreign diplomats. The bomb at the Radisson SAS exploded in the Philadelphia Ballroom, where a wedding hosting hundreds of guests was taking place. \n \nAl-Qaeda in Iraq immediately claimed the attack. After the incident, the Jordanian government pledged to take new anti-terror measures to ensure that this would not happen again. \n \nAn internet statement released the day after claimed that the bombers were: Abu Khabib, Abu Muaz, Abu Omaira and Om Omaira, all Iraqis. Al-Qaeda in Iraq immediately claimed the attack on a website, saying they were trying to hit "American and Israeli intelligence and other Western European governments". \n \nJordanians reacted to the bombings with outrage. Thousands of people in Amman participated in protests against the bombings, chanting "burn in hell, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi". King Abdullah and Queen Rania visited several victims of the bombings in hospital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC354000;On 24 May, Israel announced that it would withdraw all troops from South Lebanon. The Israeli pullout resulted in the collapse of the SLA and the rapid advance of Hezbollah forces into the area. As the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew, thousands of Shi'a Lebanese rushed back to the South to reclaim their properties. This withdrawal was widely considered a victory for Hezbollah and boosted its popularity in Lebanon. \n \nUpon Israel's withdrawal, an increasing fear that Hezbollah would seek vengeance against those thought to have supported Israel became widespread among the Christian Lebanese of the Southern Lebanon. During and after the withdrawal around 10,000 Lebanese, mostly Maronites, fled into Galilee. \n \nHezbollah later met with Lebanese Christian clerics to reassure them that the Israeli withdrawal was a victory for Lebanon as a nation, not just one sect or militia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC354001;On 14 February 2005, Rafic Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, was killed, along with 21 others, when explosives equivalent of around 1,000 kilograms of TNT (2,200 pounds) were detonated as his motorcade drove near the St. George Hotel in Beirut. \n \nAmong the dead were several of Hariri's bodyguards and his friend and former Minister of the Economy Bassel Fleihan. Hariri was buried along with his bodyguards who died in the bombing, in a location near Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque. \n \nFollowing Hariri's death, there were several other bombings and assassinations against anti-Syrian figures. These included Samir Kassir, George Hawi, Gebran Tueni, Pierre Amine Gemayel, and Walid Eido. \n \nHezbollah accused Israel of the assassination of Hariri. According to Hezbollah officials, the assassination of Hariri was planned by the Mossad as a means of expelling the Syrian army from Lebanon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC354002;In response to domestic and international pressure Syria has decided to pull its troops from Lebanon. \n \nAfter many decades of political and military domination by Syria Lebanon is finally truly an independent nation. No longer will out future be dictated by our past and Syrian roots, this is truely a glorious day for Lebanon. \n \nWe must now do as much as possible to establish our own domestic and foreign personality and promote Lebanese interests and ideas. This news is of great joy to our people and celebrations are taking part all over Lebanon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC354003;The United Nations Security Council has decided not to condemn the presence of Syrian forces in Lebanon. \n \nThis declaration by world powers has been perceived in Damascus as a sign that Syria is a legitimate ruler over Lebanon. In responce to this Syria has now presented a formal request to our government suggestion the merge of our two nations as one, this will require some consideration since it would mean the loss of our own independence. \n \nIf we reject the annexation it will damage our relations with the government in Syria and we can't be sure they will not try to achieve their goal via military action. \n \nHistorically we have ties to Syria and Lebanon was part of 'Greater Syria' so it may not be completely unrealistic for our government to accept the annexation request but just how ready is Syria to integrate such a diverse nation as Lebanon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC408002;When his father Hafez al-Assad died, Bashar was appointed leader of the Ba'ath Party and the Army, and was elected president unopposed in what the regime claimed to be a massive popular support. \n \nUntil he became president, Bashar al-Assad was not greatly involved in politics, his only public role was head of the Syrian Computer Society, which introduced the Internet to Syria in 2001. He was expected to take a more liberal approach than his father. In an interview he stated that he saw democracy in Syria as 'a tool to a better life' but then argued that it would take time for democracy to come about and that it could not be rushed. \n \nImmediately after he took office a reform movement made cautious advances during the Damascus Spring, which led al-Assad to shut down Mezzeh prison and release hundreds of political prisoners. However, security crackdowns commenced again within the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC408003;The UN ambassador to Syria has issued us with a request from the Security Council. According to the resolution recently adopted by the Security Council, Syria is demanded to withdraw all troops from Lebanon and also shut down any political activity we are conducting in the country. \n \nLebanon is historically part of 'Greater Syria' but it seems the world no longer accepts this fact. We must decide how to act in response to this request by the UN. \n \nWe can choose to leave Lebanon peacefully and fulfil the requirements of resolution 1559 but this will mean we will no longer have any sway in Lebanese internal and external affairs. \n \nOn the other hand, we can choose to press our claims without the recognition of the world but this could lead us to war with Lebanon and neither the world, the Lebanese people or the Arab League will accept our claims should we try to press them by force. \n \nWe may also consult with the Lebanese people and ask them to be part of Syria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC408004;The United Nations Security Council has confirmed our presence in Lebanon as a legitimate act, Lebanon has always been part of 'Greater Syria' and with the recent UN resolution perhaps the time has come to tie the fate of our two nations forever. \n \nWe can choose to go via the diplomatic route and present Lebanon an offer of annexation, we should take into account that Lebanon might reject our offer which could hurt our mutual relations. \n \nWe may also consider a more aggressive action and use our troops currently stationed in the country to annex the country directly without consulting the Lebanese people or its government. \n \nThis will greatly upset the government in Lebanon and may even bring down the wrath of their allies around the world, this option needs to be considered as a last resort for us. \nWe can also keep the situation as it is and not take any risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC408005;The bars and squares of Beirut are full with excitement, the wind blowing from Damascus has brought good news. \n \nAfter many decades of separation the two brothers have finally embraced each other with love and hope, Lebanon and Syria - the two nations separated by European imperialism and decade old lies are now one nation. \n \nNothing can ever break this bond between these two nations and together we will march stronger into the future no matter what it will bring. A ceremony held in the presidential palace in Beirut today marked the return of Lebanon and the Lebanese people home - to Syria. \n \nThe world has recognized our common history and heritage and now it is time to collect the fruits of this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC408006;The government in Lebanon has rejected our offer of annexation. \n \nLebanon's top political elite have refused to join Lebanon with Syria, they insist that while Lebanon indeed has historic ties to Syria which might be a justification to unite our two nations the Lebanese people have formed their own identity and no longer see themselfes as part of Syria. \n \nWith the failure of our diplomatic option we may want to consider other ways to resolve the Lebanese question, perhaps it would be best to leave things as they are and not risk in complicating the situation any further. \n \nOn the other hand this could be our last chance to incorporate Lebanon into Syria, our presence there is causing more and more dissent especially now that our diplomatic offer has been rejected and the Lebanese people see us as a potential new occupier rathan than a liberator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC114000;The 2004 Madrid train bombings were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercanías commuter train system of Madrid, Spain, on the morning of 11 March 2004 – three days before Spain's general elections and two and a half years after the September 11 attacks in the United States. \n \nThe official investigation by the Spanish judiciary found that the attacks were directed by an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell, although no direct al-Qaeda participation has been established. Controversy regarding the handling and representation of the bombings by the government arose, with Spain's two main political parties accusing each other of concealing or distorting evidence for electoral reasons. \n \nImmediately after the bombing, leaders of the PP claimed evidence indicating the Basque separatist organization, ETA was responsible for the bombings, while Islamist responsibility would have had the opposite effect, as it would have been seen as a consequence of the PP government taking Spain into the Iraq War, a policy extremely unpopular with Spaniards. \n \nThe explosions killed 191 people and wounded 1,800.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC114001;The Pyrenean ibex, Spanish common name bucardo, was one of the four subspecies of the Spanish ibex or Iberian wild goat, a species endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. Pyrenean ibex were most common in the Cantabrian Mountains, Southern France, and the northern Pyrenees. \n \nThe last natural Pyrenean ibex, a female named Celia, was found dead on January 6, 2000. Although her cause of death is known (she was killed by a fallen tree), the reason for the extinction of the subspecies as a whole is a mystery. Some hypotheses include the inability to compete with other species for food, infections and diseases, and poaching. \n \nIn January 2000, the Pyrenean ibex became extinct, but scientists have attempted to clone them using DNA from one of the last females; one such clone died seven minutes after being born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC117000;The Grand National Assembly of Turkey has elected Ahmet Necdet Sezer as the tenth President of Turkey, becoming Turkey's first head of state to come from a judicial background. He was sworn in on May 16, 2000. \n \nHis term was to expire on May 16, 2007, but because the Grand National Assembly of Turkey failed to elect a new president, he retained the office pro tempore until August 28, 2007. \n \nSezer was a firm defender of secularism, which was a point of contention between him and the ruling AKP on many issues. On many occasions, he openly stated that the secular regime in Turkey was under threat but never gave any specific reasons. During his presidency he has pardoned 260 convicted felons, 202 of whom were captured leftist militants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC147000;The people of Greenland have voted decisively in favour of a plan to give it greater autonomy from Denmark. \n \nOfficials said just over 75% of voters had supported the plan, which would see Greenland take a greater share of its annual oil revenues.It will also take control of police, courts and coast guard, and have some say in foreign policy. Correspondents say the vote could be a major step towards independence for the Arctic island of 57,000 people. \n \nThe government of Denmark must now decide how to respond to the results of the referendum. If we respect the results of the referendum Greenland will become a satellite of Denmark with its own trading policies and laws as well as limited diplomatic options. \n \nWe may also go for a more aggressive approach and impose our rule back on Greenland but this will be viewed as a hostile action and may trigger a responce from the UN and other countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120000;The opposition leaders Viktor Yushchenko (Our Ukraine), Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party of Ukraine) and Yulia Tymoshenko (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) issued a joint statement concerning "the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine". \n \nThe purpose of this coalition is to bring down the current government and governing order ruling in Ukraine. While only a mild threat this could prove a challenge in the 2004 elections for the Ukrainian presidency. \n \nWe should watch these developments closely even though there is no doubt that the conservative branch of the current ruling institution has the backing of most of the people in Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120001;The main opposition parties Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc have established the Force of the people, a coalition which aims to stop "the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine". \n \nThe true intentions of these two opposition leaders are now clear - to bring down by any means the ruling party of Ukraine and replace it with European and American influence. \n \nThis pact also includes a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Yulia Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko won the October 2004 presidential election. \n \nWe should inform our Russian counterparts regarding these developments and ask them for help in dealing with these fascist schemes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120002;It seems the opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has suffered a case of severe poisoning. \n \nThe poisoning has caused severe health problems to Mr Yushchenko but despite these problems he is back to campaign as part of the Force of The People coalition. \n \nSeveral conspiracy theories have already gone around regarding the way that Mr Yushchenko was poisoned, a dioxin poisoning has been raised as the possible cause for his recent health problems. \n \nMr Yushchenko himself has blamed the current government in his health problems after having dinner with chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service Ihor Smeshko, and his deputy, Volodymyr Satsiuk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120003;On the eve of second round of voting of the Ukrainian Presidential elections in 2004 opposition leader  Viktor Yushchenko has called for demonstrations against the official voting results. \n \nThe Yushchenko camp stated that it was the real winner of the elections based on exit polls which gave them an 11% lead over Viktor Yanukovych the incumbent prime minister. \n \nThe largest protest in Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), attracted an estimated 500,000 participants, who on 23 November 2004, peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, many wearing orange or carrying orange flags, the colour of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. \n \nThe local councils in Kiev, Lviv, and several other cities passed, with the wide popular support of their constituency, a largely symbolic refusal to accept the legitimacy of the official election results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120004;Viktor Yushchenko the opposition leader declared himself the rightful president of Ukraine as his supporters massed in front of parliament, he has taken a "presidential oath" in a closed session of parliament that only consisted of his supporters. \n \nThis oath had no legal meaning but control of the country is beginning to slip away from us. More and more supporters are arriving to Kiev mostly from Western Ukraine and the security forces will not disperse them by force. \n \nHopefully as weather conditions become more harsh these revolutionaries will pack up and leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120005;With the news of the events in West Ukraine and Kiev reaching the Eastern regions Russian minorities have begun talking and acting upon secession from Ukraine. \n \nThis cannot be allowed to happen, if we submit to the demands of the protesters in Kiev a civil war between East and West may begin, a compromise must be found for both sides to agree on. \n \nWe should send security forces to Eastern Ukraine promptly to deal with these secessionist movements that are rising up in the Eastern parts of the country. \n \nThe scale of the demonstrations in Kiev is unprecedented. By many estimates, up to one million people are on the streets, in freezing weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120006;Today, the Central Election Commission of Ukraine has confirmed that Viktor Yanukovych is the winner of the 2004 Presidential elections. \n \nThis declaration gives the government legitimacy to declare the new candidate as the winner of the elections and end this dispute once and for all. \n \nDespite this, opposition leaders claim that the committee itself is corrupt and has taken part in the alleged election fraud that have started these protests in the first place. \n \nThey have refused to accept the verdict of the committee and continue to demand a recount of the election votes. International monitors and observers have denounced the announcement by the Central Election Commission also claiming the elections did not hold up to fair democratic standards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120007;Yushchenko's camp has declared the creation of the Committee of National Salvation. \n \nThe responsibility of this committee is to monitor and arrange demonstration acts across Ukraine in coordination with opposition demands and actions in the current crisis. \n \nAlso Mr Yushchenko has called a nationwide political strike to begin as soon as possible, this strike can seriously damage our economic situation and production but it will only affect the Western regions of the country since East Ukraine is still loyal to Yanukovych. \n \nPerhaps it is time to reconsider our stern position with regards to these elections, despite our efforts it does not seem the opposition is ready to give in and end this protest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120008;On 1 December 2004, the Verkhovna Rada passed a resolution that strongly condemned pro-separatist and federalisation actions, and passed a non-confidence vote in the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. \n \nWe have refused to recognise this illegitimate vote despite the fact that by the Constitution of Ukraine, the non-confidence vote mandated the government's resignation, but parliament has no means to enforce a resignation without the co-operation of Prime Minister Yanukovych and outgoing President Kuchma. \n \nThe police and the army have refused to crack down on the protesters as well as the intelligence and security agencies, it seems there is no other way to end this overthrow but to wait until the people have exhausted their will to protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120009;The supreme court of Ukraine has ordered a revote of the run-off elections to be held. \n \nThe court decided that due to the scale of the electoral fraud it became impossible to establish the election results. Therefore, it invalidated the official results that would have given Yanukovych the presidency. \n \nhis decision was seen as a victory for the Yushchenko camp while Yanukovych and his supporters favoured a rerun of the entire election rather than just the run-off, as a second-best option if Yanukovych was not awarded the presidency. \n \nThe parliament amended laws to provide a legal framework for the new round of elections. The parliament also approved the changes to the Constitution, implementing a political reform backed by outgoing President Kuchma as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities and opposition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120010;The election revote was held under intense scrutiny of local and international observers. The preliminary results, announced by the Central Election Commission gave Yushchenko and Yanukovych 51.99% and 44.20% of the total vote. \n \nThe Yanukovych team attempted to mount a fierce legal challenge to the election results using both the Ukrainian courts and the Election Commission complaint procedures. However, all their complaints were dismissed as without merit by both the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the Central Election Commission. \n \nOn 10 January 2005 the Election Commission officially declared Yushchenko as the winner of the presidential election. This Election Commission announcement cleared the way for Yushchenko's inauguration as the President of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Orange Revolution to its peaceful conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC120011;The Prime Minister, Mr Yushchenko has been voted out of office by the Ukrainian Parliament. \n \nUkraine's economy improved during Yushchenko's cabinet service. However, his government, particularly Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, soon became embroiled in a confrontation with influential leaders of the coal mining and natural gas industries. \n \nThe conflict resulted in a 2001 no-confidence vote by the parliament, orchestrated by the Communists, who opposed Yushchenko's economic policies, and by centrist groups associated with the country's powerful "oligarchs." \n \nThe vote passed 263 to 69 and resulted in Yushchenko's removal from office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC384000;The Rizal Day bombings were a series of bombings that occurred around Metro Manila in the Philippines on December 30, 2000. The explosions occurred in close succession within a span of a few hours. Twenty-two fatalities were reported and around a hundred more suffered non-fatal injuries. \n \nFive locations were bombed almost simultaneously within the span of an hour. All of the locations were situated within the Metro Manila area on the Philippine island of Luzon. Initially, various Islamic groups were implicated in the bombings, including the Jemaah Islamiyah, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and the Moro National Liberation Front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC525000;The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake, with an epicenter near the town of Léogâne approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. \n \nThe earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other settlements in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. \n \nAn estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000 that have been widely characterized as deliberately inflated by the Haitian government. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC456000;During his campaign, Toledo promised Peruvians higher wages, a fight against poverty, anti-corruption measures, higher pensions, more employment, military reform, development of tourism, and industrialization. As Pedro Pablo Kuczynski noted “Toledo comes after almost 30 years of either dictatorships or governments that weren't so democratic. \n \nPeople expect Toledo to solve all the problems of the last 30 years, which included an enormous increase in relative poverty." Toledo's inability to fulfill many of these promises created widespread dissatisfaction. His approval ratings were consistently low throughout his presidency, sometimes sinking into single digits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC663000;The world has finally recognized our claims to Western Sahara, the recent Security Council vote is a testament to the fact that Western Sahara is and has always been part of Morocco. \n \nWhat remains now is to decide what to do with the region, we already control 80% of the territory while the remaining territory is controlled by the Polisario Front. If we attempt to outright annex the land it is likely a conflict will erupt that could drag the region to war including Algeria that supports the Polisario Front, an annexation attempt will also be viewed as a hostile act by the security council and could be followed by sanctions by the UN. \n \nThe other option is to offer an extensive autonomy in the region and avoid a conflict but such a decision could have a destabilizing effect at home especially after the massive resources we have invested in fighting the Polisario Front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC663001;The 2003 Casablanca bombings were a series of suicide bombings on May 16, 2003, in Casablanca, Morocco. The attacks were the deadliest terrorist attacks in the country's history. 45 people were killed as a result of these attacks. The suicide bombers came from the shanty towns of Sidi Moumen, a poor suburb of Casablanca. \n \nThe 14 bombers, most between 20 and 23 years old, bombed several places on the night of May the 16th. In the deadliest attack, bombers wearing explosives knifed a guard at the "Casa de España" restaurant, a Spanish-owned eatery in the city. They blew themselves up inside the building, killing 20 people, many of them Muslims dining and playing bingo. \n \nThe five-star Hotel Farah was bombed next, killing a guard and a porter. Another bomber killed three passersby as he attempted to bomb a Jewish cemetery. Two additional bombers attacked a Jewish community center, but killed no one because the building was closed and empty. In all, 12 bombers died, along with 33 civilians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC57000;The Kingdom of Morocco has attacked our ally the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. Morocoo was given a mandate by the United Nations Security Council to set up an autonomy in Western Sahara and has instead chosen to annex the entire territory, we need to decide how to handle this delicate situation. \n \nWe can declare a full scale war against Morocco and assist the Polisario Front in their fight against Morocco, it is likely they will not be able to stand for too long again Morocco without our aid. \n \nAnother option is to give only limited military aid to the Polisario Front in arms and supplies without a direct intervention, this will upset them slightly. \n \nA third option is to stay out of this conflict entirely and take the matter to the UN Security Council and allow the council to try and resolve this matter with pressure from world powers, this will greatly upset the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732000;Twenty-six-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi had been the sole income earner in his extended family of eight. He operated a vegetable cart for seven years in Sidi Bouzid south of Tunis. \n \nOn 17 December 2010, a policewoman confiscated his cart and produce. Bouazizi, who had such an event happen to him before, tried to pay the 10-dinar fine (a day's wages, equivalent to 7USD). In response the policewoman insulted his deceased father and slapped him. \n \nA humiliated Bouazizi then went to the provincial headquarters in an attempt to complain to local municipality officials and to have his produce returned. He was refused an audience. \n \nWithout alerting his family, at 11:30 am and within an hour of the initial confrontation, Bouazizi returned to the headquarters, doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself on fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732001;Following recents events in $COUNTRYNAME$ our intelligence services and police forces are reporting high levels of agitation among the population. \n \nSome ministers have suggested that perhaps the time has come to start a new phase in how the rulling party is governing the country, while this move could reduce tensions it may also show weakness. \n \nWith the current government being in power for so long and any opposition suppressed it is not clear how a new regime will handle the administration of the country. We should consider our options carefully...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732002;More troubling reports are coming it. \n \nOur strong methods against the protesters have proved ineffective and more people are joining in to protest against the government, perhaps this is the time to reconsider our approach to this whole situation before it is too late. \n \nRelinguishing power will mean that a new government will take place and our ability to influance the next heads of government will be very limited, it is also possible that the new regime will take vengence on the current one once it is in power. \n \nOn the other hand we can continue to resits the protests and hope for the best..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732003;A general strike has been announced by the opposition leaders. \n \nWith a general stike in place our industries have shut down and we can no longer keep up production of equipment or training of new recruits, in a way this is a declaration of war by the opposition on the ruling regime and a surprising amount of people has joined the opposition following the announcment. \n \nPerhpas now is the time to cave in? Or maybe we should show the opposition leaders that we are not swayed by this attempt to destabelize the regime?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732004;The general stike had not managed to topple the regime. \n \nWhile this is good news for the current rulling elite it means that the opposition have turned to less peaceful ways to get what they want. \n \nThe police are reporting massive waves of violence across the entire country and many security forces are injured, can we sustain this for long or should we perhaps aknoledge the opposition and start the process of handing power to them?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732005;Our capital is no longer safe. \n \nThe violence that our country has been overrun with has now reached our stronghold in the capital and we are no longer safe from the vultures that are looking at slicing whats left of the country apart. \n \nBut perhaps this is the oppotunity to rally our supporters with the government and display unity in the fight against the forces of destruction and dissent that have done all the damage so far to our great nation? If this fails we could find ourselfes on the edge of a bloody civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732006;Civil war begins. \n \nDespite our attemps at calming the situation down the opposition has refused to let go of the claims for the government of the country and now a bloody chapter is ahead of us, a civil war has broken out in our country and we must fight to protct our principles... there is no more time for talk, armed struggle is the only option left. \n \nThe only comfort we have is that the opposition has broken into various groups each seeking to advance its own goals, that may make it easier for us to take them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732001;Following the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi protests have begun in the city of Sidi Bouzid after the local police have dispersed marches of the local population. \n \nShops have been looted and cars have been set on fire, the protest currently seems to be local and the police has no reason to be belived they may spread further in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732002;With the failure of the government to answer the demands of protesters the disscontent with the government has grown larger and has now spread further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC732003;The opposition movements as well as various labour movements have announced a general strike today and a refusal to pay taxes, this will have considerable consequenses on our country's economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648001;Leader, we have incoming reports of unrest in Benghazi. \n \nIt seems the government overthrow that has occured in neighbouring Tunisia has inspired some radical ideas among the population, they have begun marching in the streets demanding reforms and political freedom. \n \nWhile Tunisia has always been a country which doesn't enforce the rules of Islam very tightly Libya is a whole different scenerio, the revolution that has installed the current regime cannot be replaced by any other government and we must stand our ground. \n \nThis is no doubt an attempt by our enemies to destabilize Libya and bring war to our beloved country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648002;Leader, our calls to the public to calm down have not been answered. \n \nIt seems that instead of dying down the protesters have increased in numbers and are now forming opposition movements that are calling to challange the government, they are backed by foreign countries and their organisation is stronger than we could have anticipated. \n \nWe must decide how to deal with them now before these take root and become a true challange to our rulling regime which has held firm despite all the attempts to bring it down, no doubt our attempt to keep our own country and Africa from the petro dollar has had an effect. \n \nPerhaps we should consider to give in to their demands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648003;Leader, a general strike has been called by the opposition forces. \n \nThey are refusing to pay taxes and our economy will no doubt feel the effects of this sinful act, it is time we act against these mobs of terrorists and bring down this whole idea that the government can be challenged. \n \nA crackdown on the protesters as well as arrests will surely persuade that these attepms to bring the government down are futile and will not bare fruit no matter how much support they may have from the outside. \n \nOn the other hand perhaps it is time to a more peaceful transition of power, it could help us avoid a civil war but it is not clear how the new regime will deal with remains of the old and could be a dangerous path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648004;Leader, the strikes and any attempt to reason with the opposition are now over. \n \nThe "National Transitional Council" have declared that their fight against the government is a peacful one but reports are coming from all over the country of attack on government peronal and buildings, the police are unable to protect the population and looting is wide spread. \n \nThis opposition that calims to represent the people are nothing more but a group of bandits that have gathered up with support from the west to bring our regime down and end the indpendence of Libya that we worked so hard since the Al Fateh Revolution. \n \nBy clearing the capital from these traitors we can avoid any surprises in futurr dealing with these rebels calling to bring down the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648005;Leader, our might captital Tripoli is no longer safe from the forces of destruction and treason. \n \nWhile more stable than other parts of the country and especailly the Eastern parts where the "Libyan Opposition" has established its foothod, we have many reports coming in of protests and even armed attacks against government targets in Tripoli. \n \nWe are losing control of the situation and our enemies seem to be growing stronger by every day, something must be done to bring the situation back under our control, our army is strong and loyal. \n \nPerhaps it is the time to send a strong message to the "Opposition Forces" and deal them a blow they cannot recover from. \n \nWe may also choose to transfer power to the opposition but it is unclear who exactly will take power instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC648006;The first Libyan Civil War, also referred to as the Libyan Revolution was an armed conflict fought between forces loyal to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and those seeking to oust his government. \n \nThe war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on 8 August 2009, and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd. \n \nThe protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country, ith the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the §YNational Transitional Council§W. \n \nThe rebels were composed primarily of civilians, such as teachers, students, lawyers, and oil workers, as well as police officers and a contingent of professional soldiers that defected from the Libyan Army and joined the rebels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC597001;Muammar Gaddafi, the deposed leader of Libya, died on 20 October 2011 during the Battle of Sirte. Gaddafi was found hiding in a culvert west of Sirte and captured by National Transitional Council forces. \n \nHe was killed shortly afterwards. The NTC initially claimed he died from injuries sustained in a firefight when loyalist forces attempted to free him, although videos of his last moments show rebel fighters beating him before he was shot several times. \n \nn its immediate aftermath, the killing of Gaddafi was thought to have significant implications in the Middle East, as a critical part of the wider 'Arab Spring'. Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said he wished Gaddafi had remained alive so he could be tried for crimes against humanity, but now that he was dead, Libya would need a meticulous plan for the transition to democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
